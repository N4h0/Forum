To test our Forum-application to the fully, one needs to see it from three different sides: SuperAdmin, Member and non-registered. 
As a non-registered user, you are able to click around and navigate, but not edit or commit any data in the view.
As a registered user or member, you can create posts and send reply on posts. But to use all the features in the application, one needs to login to the SuperAdmin.


Demo Navigation
To explore the application, you can for example use the following example navigation path:

Home > Sport > Cross-country skiing > Equipment and maintenance > Skiing
https://localhost:7205/Post/PostDetails/11

E-mail: superAdmin@superAdmin.com
