To test our Forum-application to the fully, one needs to see it from three different sides: SuperAdmin, Member and non-registered. 
As a non-registered user, you are able to click around and navigate, but not edit or commit any data in the view.
As a registered user or member, you can create posts and send reply on posts. But to use all the features in the application, one needs to login to the SuperAdmin.

E-mail: superAdmin@superAdmin.com
